Roadmap To Become A Flutter Developer (Resources for Beginners)

Hello Everyone, This article is inlined for those who are keen to start with flutter, A roadmap for beginners to learn gradually from all the necessary resources.

## What is Flutter?
> Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for [mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web), and [desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop) from a single codebase.

## Why Flutter??

We already know there are a lot of frameworks out there that provide the cross-platform functionality then what makes flutter standalone in this rat race?

## What to Start With First?

Flutter is fast and easy, If you are familiar with java or any object-oriented language you are good to go but I strongly recommend that you should have the basic knowledge of Dart.

These are some videos that you might find helpful to watch.

## How Does Flutter work under the hood?

Your dart code is directly compiled to native using AOT (Ahead of time ) compilation because iOS doesn’t allow dynamic compilation.

Flutter is fast and easy to use, now let's check out how we can install it.

## How to Install Flutter?

Here’s the link to the developer docs where you can start to install the flutter in the OS you have.

## Create your flutter project
> To create flutter project

    flutter create <project-name>

or you can use the IDE (Intellij, Android Studio, etc)

## Project overview

When you create the flutter app you will see these files and folders, Most of the code is written in **dart **in lib folder and when In case of the native requirement android and ios are required.

![[https://dev.to/jay_tillu/flutter-project-structure-1lhe](https://dev.to/jay_tillu/flutter-project-structure-1lhe)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*57hqc9iUBpkxeeY-.png)*[https://dev.to/jay_tillu/flutter-project-structure-1lhe](https://dev.to/jay_tillu/flutter-project-structure-1lhe)*

An article by [Jay Tillu](https://dev.to/jay_tillu) explaining about the project structure.

or you can use

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/70311f3d3b4d70c63c09564f6cfbc8a4" frameborder=0></iframe>

Have got excited when you first app launches (Technically it's not yours, Code was already there 😜 ). I got excited too 🎉.

When you create your flutter app you will see there is already code for a counter app.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Vh_CsLzsRw9_3-fHI8YMmA.gif)

When you run the code, you will see this. This is a simple counter application where you have a FAB(FloatingActionButton) and Text which indicate how many times the FAB has been pressed.

## Widgets in flutter

If you see the code you will see StatefulWidget and StatelessWidget. Before we dive into that let's understand what is a **Widget** in a flutter.
[**Introduction to widgets**
*Flutter widgets are built using a modern framework that takes inspiration from React. The central idea is that you…*flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro)

Basically, everything you see in your flutter app is a widget.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2536/1*T6KZgE8Ak6nfqOji5hMa2w.jpeg)

I find this explanation very accurate about “What is a Widget in Flutter”
[**What is a Widget in Flutter?**
*Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow! Please be sure to answer the question. Provide details and share…*stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50958238/what-is-a-widget-in-flutter)

There’s also a youtube playlist ([**Widget of the week](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU23XGwz3Km7sQZFTdB996iG)** )provided by the Flutter team that only talks about Widgets in flutter.

Now

## What is a Stateful and Stateless Widget?

In* Stateless *Widget*, *all of its properties are *immutable *which means a StatelessWidget will never *rebuild* by itself (but can from external events) but a StatefulWidget can.

## How to create UI in flutter?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2212/1*AUFhr2SFL9_qhUms7tQeUA.jpeg)

To build the UI in a flutter, you need to get a basic understanding of the layouts and how to work with them.

## How to add interactions in your app?

In flutter, you cannot just assign a value and leave it

Example

    String value="Hello";

    ------------------------------
    Text(value);

    ---SOMEWHERE IN THE CODE------

    onTap(){

    value="How are you?";

    }

if you think the text is going to change then you are wrong 🙅‍♂️ , you will have to use setState().

    onTap(){

    setState({

    value="How are you?";

    });

    }

Adding setState() will rebuild the widget and display the change.
